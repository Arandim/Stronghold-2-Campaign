**Story Developement:**
The rescue of Sir Grey helps us to overcome our new enemies Olaf and Sir Barkley. But their relentless attacks against our walls and their supperior castles are frightening. I don't know how I will be able to beat Olaf let alone Barkley in his well established position. If I don't launch the rescue mission right away I am afraid I won't have the resources nor the time to rescue Sir Grey in between the never ending attacks. Maybe I have to delay the rescue and try to free him after the invasions.

## Mission B: Kill Olaf
**Reward:**
* Unlock available Trooptype:
  * Pictish Boat Warrior
  * Battering Ram
  * Siege Tower
  * Mantlet
* Olafs estate has been razed to the ground it is now yours Sire.

**Story Developement:**
Olaf is dead! Now we have to face our strongest enemy yet. Lord Barkleys' castle seems nearly impenatrable. Maybe we can storm his walls with ladders or siege towers. The other possibility is to take down his gatehouses with battering rams. Maybe we even have to do both. What concerns me though is that my spies reported that he had a very good connection to Sir Edwin and his supplies concerning pitch due to his access to the western swamps. I am afraid some of my soldiers will have to burn to their deaths trying to storm his mountain. Either way I have to be carefull not to destroy anything in the upper keep of Lord Barkleys estate because I don't have the slightest clue how to rebuild any of that. (This only includes the buildings on the plateau of Lord Barkleys keep and the monastery next to the keep. The rest is possible to rebuild)

**Win Conditions:**

* No enemies or invasions left
* Rescue Sir Grey
* Kill Olaf
* Kill Sir Barkley
* Rewards:
	
  * Monks
	


# Chapter 4: The final dance
## Mission A: There are no rats or gong left in your estate

* Hint: It is very important to get rid of all the rats and the gong as soon as possible. The longer you wait the more instances will occur that will slow down your production and lower your reputation. They will be announced frequently so you will get an understanding how dire the situation is. Note: If you don't manage to complete Mission A you will have a peasent revolt 140 months into the game. They will spawn directly at your keep and try to kill your lord.
	
**Story Developement:**
I finally got the situation under control and I have the feeling that the peasents start to like me. Now it is time to grow my economy as fast as possible to prepare for the unavoidable battle ahead.

## Mission B: Prepare for the feast

* Acquire:
	
  * 6500 Honor
  * 50 ale
  * 50 candles
  * 50 silk
  * 100 eel
  * 100 goose
  * 200 pigs
  * 200 vegetables
  * 200 wine
  * 500 apples
  * 500 bread
  * 500 cheese
  * 500 meat
  * 400 population
	
* Hint: You have to balance how much of the food is used in order to acquire enough honor in the limited amount of time and to keep the population happy. You can manage what type of food is eaten by the peasents by selecting your granary and what type of food is consumed during the normal banquets by selecting the Lord's Kitchen.
* Hint: In order to have enough banquet supplies in 160 months you might have to use your estates to produce some of the goods and transport them to your estate by using Carter Posts. You will certainly need that for the wheat production because your new estate is up in the mountains and you can't build wheat farms there. You can however priduce the bread in your estate if you wish to do so.
